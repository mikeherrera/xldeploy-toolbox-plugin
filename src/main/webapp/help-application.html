<div>
    <p>Specify the name or ID of the application, e.g. "PetClinic" or "Applications/MyDirectory/PetClinic".</p>
    <p>If only the name is specified and the application does not exist, the application will be created during the
        import of the dar. If the fully qualified id is specified and the application does not exist, the application
        will be created is the directory specified during import. Please note that the directory has to exist in the
        XL Deploy Repository.</p>
    <p>Note that in any XL Deploy instance, the application name must be unique even across directories. Also, for
        backwards compatibility reasons, only the name (not the full ID) is used to find an application. Thus, an
        application can be freely moved among XL Deploy directories without needing to change the Jenkins job
        configuration.</p>
    <p>You can use <a href="/env-vars.html">Jenkins Env variables</a>, e.g. Applications/MyDirectory/$JOB_NAME</p>
